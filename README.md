Instead of the test systems unit, which is our current area of expertise, we had the opportunity to be in the R&D area, gain various insights, and observe system-level work. First, we had the opportunity to observe the work of our R&D interns. They had also undertaken various projects planned to benefit the company.
Then, we had the opportunity to tour the R&D workshop. In the workshop, we observed the testing and final state of the company's various system products. The operating principles and system state tests of numerous HTR products, such as Pan-Tilt and GÃ¶rsen, were particularly observed.
Following this, the limits of a product undergoing active testing were tested, its efficiency was tested, and its durability was assessed. This provided valuable experience in how system-level testing is conducted and how system-level test engineers work.
