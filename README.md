Day 1 (01.07.2025 tuesday) (1. week)
On the first day of the twenty-day internship, the company hosted a breakfast specially prepared for the interns. The interns were then taken to the seminar hall and briefed about the internship process. The interns were informed about the planned internship process, including key points to consider during the process, and speeches were made by board members. Following the seminar, a lunch break was held. After the lunch break, each intern was assigned a unique ID card to allow them to enter and exit the company and specific areas within the company. Because this process was carried out step-by-step for each intern, the process took considerable time, and the day concluded.
Day 2 (02.07.2025 wednesday) (1. week)
Today, we took a tour of the company's departments. All departments, including R&D, Production, and Testing, were visited. We had the opportunity to hear from engineers about their work and how they operate, as well as observe their workspaces. The tour took quite a while, as the company has a large number of departments. Afterward, the interns were informed of the departments they would be assigned to during their internship. My department was designated as Test Systems.
Day 3 (03.07.2025 thursday) (1. week)
After breakfast today, the interns gathered in the seminar hall. Engineers from the units where the interns would be doing their internships came to meet the interns and then escorted them to their units. The manager of the test systems unit explained the terminology of test systems. He explained in detail what was done in the test section, the hierarchy, the measurement instruments used and their types, and the various terms and abbreviations we might encounter in the test area. This way, by the time we moved into the test area, we were already familiar with the terminology we'd heard from the engineers and technicians working in the field. We then met with the engineers and technicians in the test unit. After the introduction, we were given a tour of the test areas. We were given the opportunity to observe the state-of-the-art production and test equipment used. Our questions about the equipment were answered by the relevant personnel. At the end of the day, we were assigned to research various measurement instruments such as oscilloscopes and multimeters.
Day 4 (04.07.2025 friday) (1. week)
Today, using computers provided by the company, the interns conducted research on measuring instruments such as oscilloscopes, network analyzers, and spectrum analyzers, which were among the research tasks assigned yesterday. The characteristics of the company's highly advanced measuring devices were investigated, noting their usage, usage patterns, and various unknown features. Afterwards, the test area was toured and the active testing operations were observed. A wide variety of board-based tests are being conducted within a large test area where different measurements are applied in different areas. The tests performed by the units vary depending on the board type. Various tests were observed, including RF printed circuit boards for radar and power printed circuit boards. Software, electrical, and functional tests performed for these boards were observed, and the procedures performed by the relevant testing personnel, along with the devices and equipment used, were explained.
Day 5 (07.07.2025 monday) (2. week)
The oscilloscopes studied theoretically yesterday were examined and used in practice today, demonstrating various features (trigger, math, fft, etc.). Subsequently, the tests were observed, which involved testing a digital printed circuit board. There was a problem loading the relevant software onto the digital board. Despite following the steps outlined in the documentation shared with the testing unit during the testing process, intensive work was observed to resolve the issue. Details of the progress in test engineering were then explained and observed. The product stages and the procedures used were observed to record the results.
Day 6 (08.07.2025 Tuesday) (2. week)
Today, to streamline the documentation process mentioned yesterday, our mentor asked us interns to design an interface. The interface would allow technicians to easily, quickly, and accurately enter all the necessary information in one go. We were told we could design the interface using the C++ programming language, and we were shown an example of how the interface, previously designed by our mentor, worked. We were asked to design an interface for the repair unit within the Test team. We met with the technicians working in the repair unit to determine the necessary requirements. After obtaining the necessary information, work began. First, the company requested that the necessary software for the interface be installed on the computers provided to the interns. After the IT department completed the necessary procedures, the computers were received, and the interface design began. The day progressed in this manner.
Day 7 (09.07.2025 Wednesday) (2. week)
Today, work continued on the interface design task undertaken yesterday. Structures such as textboxes, labels, and comboboxes were created using the C++ programming language. Functionality was later added to these structures. There was a request that the user's input be recorded in an Excel file format. Initially, the requested information was being saved in .csv format. However, the mentor pointed out that this format was inappropriate; the file extension should have been .xlsx, the extension of Excel files. Despite the extensive design work, the interface's visual quality could not be improved. When the mentor was informed of this, he stated that he had misremembered and had designed the design using C#. Since the relevant software was installed on the computers in C++, the decision was made to continue work in C# tomorrow.
Day 8 (10.07.2025 Thursday) (2. week)
Today, we went to the IT department to add the necessary software for the computers, but due to their busy schedule, we were told they could look into it after lunch. Our mentor then assigned us to troubleshoot the test area. Before we delved into troubleshooting, we were given some documents related to the printed circuit board we were asked to handle. These included the circuit schematic and the BOM (bill of material) documents, which contain the location information for the components on the board. After reviewing the documents and asking and receiving answers to various questions, we began working on troubleshooting until lunchtime. Because some common problems were encountered during the troubleshooting phase, the test engineer also shared the troubleshooting documentation, written to expedite the process, to guide us. Following the shared documents, we identified the faults on three printed circuit boards and submitted them to the relevant departments for further action. After lunch, we went to the IT department to download and install the necessary software. We then conducted various research and source scans to develop the interface in C#. The interface design was then initiated.
Day 9 (11.07.2025 Friday) (2. week)
Today, the interface design in C#, which began yesterday, continued and made considerable progress. The general working principle is an interface that requests various information from the user and saves the resulting data in an Excel file (with an .xlsx extension). User errors were prevented by character limits, comboboxes, and structures such as forcing the user to select from a pre-made list. We made rapid progress throughout the day, and when necessary, we met with the mentor to obtain feedback. Since the interface was designed with satisfaction, it was crucial that it would actually be used in the company, and dozens of checks were made to ensure that most situations that the user might encounter or that the interface might fail were carefully considered during the design process. 
Day 10 (14.07.2025 Monday) (3. week)
Today, the interface development work in C#, which began last week, continued. The interface design for the repair unit was started from scratch. Notes from the weekend's preliminary work on the interface were implemented, and meetings were held with the mentor to gather the necessary feedback. Additions and deletions were made based on the feedback received, and many problems were encountered due to the method chosen last week. When switching to C# programming, the interface design started from scratch due to numerous errors encountered in adapting the existing C++ language to C#. Because the design was generally defined, progress was quite rapid. By the end of the day, the design was almost finalized, and our mentor, having successfully developed the application into an .exe application, was highly appreciated. He requested updates based on the final few feedback pieces he received.
Day 11 (16.07.2025 Wednesday) (3. week)
Today, the final changes requested yesterday were implemented and the mentor was contacted. He expressed his satisfaction, and we were asked to design an interface that would allow for tracking repairs on the testing side. This interface had relatively fewer requirements. Work began on a design that would utilize the already designed interface, also in C# and similarly save to an Excel file with an .xlsx extension. Existing usable sections were taken directly from the other project, and new sections that needed to be added or changed were corrected. As with the previous interface project, we met with the mentor periodically to gather feedback, and changes were implemented based on feedback. These included details on character limits within textboxes, changes to combobox structures, and simplicity and simplicity to ensure visual appeal and user friendliness. The majority of the interface was completed within the day.
Day 12 (17.07.2025 Thursday) (3. week)
The new interface, originally planned for design yesterday, has been finalized today. The mentor requested a significant feature be added to the interface. This request was generally about user organization, with the request for an admin page that would allow password access in cases such as staff changes. The need a dedicated admin page was needed, and this page should only be accessible by entering the correct password. After several different ideas, the method described above was decided upon to prevent various security vulnerabilities. Implementing this update to the interface required significant new information, which required considerable time. In the final hours of the day, changes were implemented based on feedback from the mentor, and the day concluded.
Day 13 (18.07.2025 Friday) (3. week)
Today, following the completion of the interface design process, troubleshooting continued. Work continued on the same type of printed circuit boards. The boards being studied are power boards, specialized boards that work with other boards and provide various power supplies. Before working with the boards, ESD protective equipment (ESD apron and wrist straps) is worn. Unlike last week's troubleshooting, this week's work focused on more difficult problems. During last week's troubleshooting, the boards provided by the engineers had integrated circuits. They had anticipated this and provided these boards to the interns for easier troubleshooting. Today's troubleshooting efforts revealed various problems, not just at a single point, but at various points. These included missing solder, solder spatter, and component failures. These faults were identified and repairs were requested. These boards will then be retested. The process will continue based on whether they pass or fail. A total of seven boards were examined in this manner throughout the day.
